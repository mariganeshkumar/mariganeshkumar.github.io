  abstract={In this paper, we use an in-house rule-based phoneme-level common label set (CLS) representation to train multilingual and code-switching ASR for Indian languages. We propose a modification to the E2E model, wherein the CLS representation and the native language characters are used simultaneously for training. We show our results on the multilingual and code-switching (MUCS) ASR challenge 2021. Our best results achieve â‰ˆ6% and 5% improvement in word error rate over the baseline system}

  abstract={In this paper, we devise algorithms for detection and classification of artifacts. Classification of artifacts into head nod, jaw movement and eye-blink is performed using two different varieties of time warping; namely, linear time warping, and dynamic time warping. The average accuracy of 85% and 90% is obtained using the former, and the later, respectively.},

  abstract={To effectively extract person-specific signatures present in EEG, it is necessary to define a subspace that enhances the biometric information and suppresses other nuisance factors. i-vector and x-vector are state-of-art subspace techniques used in speaker recognition. In this paper, novel modifications are proposed for both frameworks to project person-specific signatures from multi-channel EEG into a subspace. The modified i-vector and x-vector systems outperform baseline i-vector and x-vector systems with an absolute improvement of 10.5% and 15.9%, respectively.},

   abstract={Inspired by the state-of-the-art x-vector based speaker verification approach, this paper proposes a time-delay shallow neural network (TD-SNN) for spoof detection for both logical and physical access. The novelty of the proposed TD-SNN system vis-a-vis conventional DNN systems is that it can handle variable length utterances during testing. Performance of the proposed TD-SNN systems and the baseline Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) is analyzed on the ASV-spoof-2019 dataset. The performance of the systems is measured in terms of the minimum normalized tandem detection cost function (min-t-DCF). When studied with individual features, the TD-SNN system consistently outperforms the GMM system for physical access. For logical access, GMM surpasses TD-SNN systems for certain individual features. When combined with the decision-level feature switching (DLFS) paradigm, the best TD-SNN system outperforms the best baseline GMM system on evaluation data with a relative improvement of 48.03\% and 49.47\% for both logical and physical access, respectively.},
