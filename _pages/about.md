I (Mari Ganesh Kumar) obtained Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My thesis focused on applied machine learning and signal processing to speech and other bio-signals.  I have published multiple papers in the domain of Speech, EEG, and Neuronal signals. In simple terms, I can make machines learn a new language overnight or recognize your voice. My work revolves around improving such algorithms.

Before joining IIT Madras, I was a backend developer at Zoho Corporation. I obtained bachelor's degree in computer science from Thiagarajar College of Engineering as an awardee of the best outgoing student medal. I'm currently working on Computer Vision problems for an upcoming AI platform (MavQ by the MTX Group).
